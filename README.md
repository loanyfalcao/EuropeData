# EuropeData

> Status: Finished

In the last 40 years it is possible to notice a significant reduction in the number of teenage pregnancies (under 30 years of age) while the number of risk pregnancies (over 34 years of age) has increased. The project analyzes the ages of pregnant women in Europe with data collected from the website [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/urb_cfermor/default/table?lang=en&category=urb.urb_cgc)

#### Applied filters:
+ Data between 1980 and 2020
+ Countries with less than 20 years of data
+ Countries without outliers (analysis done with boxplot)

#### Ages were categorized into:
+ 19 years or younger
+ Between 19 and 35 years old
+ 35 years or younger


##### Finally, a [PowerBi](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNGZlNTYxZWUtOWE3Yi00MmIwLTg3NTQtNjU0MTQ0OWVhYjRjIiwidCI6ImZhNzk1MzFjLThjZTUtNGJkMy05N2VlLTI0NWU2ZWUyNjZiOCJ9) was created with two analyzes between 1980-2020 and 2000-2020:
<table>
   <thead>
      <th>Between 1980 and 2020</th>
      <th>Between 2000 and 2020</th>
   </thead>

      </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>


#### Teen Pregnancy
Understanding that teenage pregnancy is a risk for the mother and causes several social problems, it is important to analyze which countries have rates higher than the European average (3%). It is possible to highlight Hungary as one of the countries with the lowest reduction in the rate of teenage pregnancies.

<table>
   <thead>
      <th>Europe</th>
      <th>Hungary</th>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td><img width="220" alt="image" src="https://github.com/loanyfalcao/EuropeData/assets/156198809/71278aa6-a62d-4e96-9d13-e2b29bf053e5"></td>

      </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>



#### Risk Pregnancy
Based on the data, it is possible to define that the rate of risk pregnancies tends to increase over the next few years, making it necessary for the health system to be able to receive these women and provide the best treatment. Therefore, it is important to highlight the countries that show a greater increase than the European average, understanding that these countries need to seek improvements aimed at these women with greater urgency.
