# EuropeData
The project analyzes the ages of pregnant women in Europe with data collected from the website: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/urb_cfermor/default/table?lang=en&category=urb.urb_cgc

Firstly, the data is processed, removing countries with samples under 20 years old.

Ages were categorized into:
1. 19 years or younger
2. Between 19 and 35 years old
3. 35 years or younger

Countries that presented a large number of residues during the period are also removed.
